# MVVM Architecture with Dagger Hilt and Retrofit

## Overview

Welcome to the MVVM Architecture with Dagger Hilt and Retrofit project! This Android application serves as a practical demonstration of the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architecture, incorporating modern Android development technologies. The key components include Dagger Hilt for dependency injection, Retrofit for efficient REST API calling, and Kotlin Coroutines for asynchronous programming.

## Features

- **Kotlin:** The primary programming language used, bringing concise syntax and modern features.
- **MVVM Architecture:** Organizes the codebase into Model, View, and ViewModel components for a scalable and maintainable structure.
- **Dagger Hilt:** Implements a lightweight and powerful dependency injection framework for seamless object creation and management.
- **Retrofit API Calling:** Utilizes Retrofit for effortless and efficient communication with RESTful APIs.
- **Kotlin Coroutines:** Leverages coroutines for simplified and concise asynchronous programming.
- **Glide Image Loading:** Integrates Glide to efficiently load and display images within the application.
- **View Binding:** Enhances type safety by utilizing View Binding for accessing views in activities and fragments.
- **Pagination:** Implements pagination for handling large data sets efficiently.
- **Base Fragment Class:** Creates a base class for fragments to encapsulate common functionality and reduce boilerplate code.
- **Recycler Adapter for Layout:** Utilizes a custom RecyclerView adapter for flexible and dynamic layout management.


Happy coding!
